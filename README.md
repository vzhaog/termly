# Termly Privacy Compliance Made Simple: Save 25% on Annual Plans, Free Forever Tier Available

Let's be real — dealing with privacy compliance sounds about as fun as reading tax law while sitting in traffic. But here's the thing: if you run a website or app, you don't really have a choice anymore. Between GDPR, CCPA, and about two dozen other alphabet soup regulations, one wrong move could land you in hot water.

That's where Termly comes in. Think of it as your friendly neighborhood compliance assistant that actually makes sense.

## What Exactly Is Termly?

Termly is basically a Swiss Army knife for privacy compliance. It's a cloud-based platform that helps you generate privacy policies, manage cookie consent, and generally keep you on the right side of privacy laws without needing a law degree or emptying your bank account on lawyers.

Over 2 million businesses use it. That's not because they all suddenly developed a passion for legal documents — it's because Termly makes something complicated feel almost... easy.

## The Free Plan (Yes, Actually Free)

Here's something refreshing: Termly has a genuinely useful free tier that's not just a glorified trial. Perfect for bootstrapping startups or side projects that aren't making money yet.

What you get:
- One basic legal policy (typically a privacy policy)
- Cookie policy and consent banner
- 10,000 monthly banner views
- Quarterly cookie scans
- HTML embeddable policies
- Cookie script auto-blocker

Is it limited? Sure. But it's legit free compliance coverage, which beats the alternative of having nothing at all or copying someone else's policy and hoping for the best.

## Paid Plans: Where Things Get Interesting

### Starter Plan: $10/month (Annual) or $14/month (Monthly)

This is the sweet spot for small businesses ready to take compliance seriously without breaking the bank.

You get:
- 2 legal policies
- 10 policy edits per month
- 50,000 monthly banner views
- Monthly cookie scans
- Regular policy updates when laws change
- Privacy regulation monitoring

Think of this as your "I'm serious about this business" tier. Two policies typically cover your privacy policy and terms of service — the bare minimum for most legitimate operations.

### Pro+ Plan: $15/month (Annual) or $20/month (Monthly) — MOST POPULAR

This is where Termly really shines. For just five bucks more on the annual plan, you unlock basically everything.

The works include:
- **Unlimited** legal policies
- **Unlimited** policy edits
- **Unlimited** banner views
- Weekly cookie scans (vs. monthly)
- Auto-updated policies
- Multi-language support
- Google Consent Mode v2
- IAB TCF 2.3 compliance
- Custom banner styles
- Regional consent rules
- Multi-user permissions
- Remove Termly branding

Here's why this matters: if you're running an actual business with real traffic, you'll probably need more than two policies. Cookie policy? Check. Terms and conditions? Check. EULA? Check. Return policy? Check. The list goes on.

Plus, unlimited banner views means you won't get surprised by overage charges when your site starts getting traction.

### Agency Plan: Custom Pricing

Managing multiple client websites or running an agency? This plan bundles everything in Pro+ with bulk pricing discounts, multi-domain management, training, and white-label options.

## What Do Real People Think?

I dug through hundreds of reviews, and here's what actual users are saying:

**The Good Stuff:**
- "It's SO easy to use. I don't need to understand all the legal details." — Privacy Engineer user
- "When a policy changes, just edit and click publish. No hunting through your whole site." — Long-time user
- "Customer service responds in under a few hours. Very professional." — Small business owner
- "The cookie banner functionality just works. No headaches." — eCommerce site owner

**The Not-So-Good:**
- Some users want more customization options for niche industries
- A few mentioned wishing it was slightly cheaper for professional plans
- Templates are primarily UK English focused (minor complaint for US users)
- Free plan is pretty basic (but hey, it's free)

The consensus? For 95% of businesses, Termly hits the sweet spot between comprehensive and actually usable. It's not perfect, but it's way better than the alternatives (which are usually "hire an expensive lawyer" or "do nothing and hope for the best").

## What Makes Termly Different?

### Actually Updated Policies

Privacy laws change. A lot. Termly's legal team monitors regulations globally and pushes updates automatically. Your policies stay current without you lifting a finger.

Recent updates have included:
- AI-based services disclosure options
- Data Privacy Framework compliance
- Global Privacy Control (GPC) support
- SMS text messaging regulations (TCPA)
- Financial incentive programs for Colorado residents

### Cookie Scanning That Works

The cookie scanner crawls your site, finds all the tracking mechanisms, and automatically categorizes them. This is huge because most site owners have no idea how many third-party cookies are lurking in their site.

### Covers 28+ Privacy Laws

GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, ePrivacy, LGPD, Quebec's Law 25, 16 U.S. state laws — Termly's got you covered. You're not just building for today's compliance; you're future-proofing.

### Google Certified CMP Partner

Termly has Google's gold-level CMP certification. If you're running Google Ads or Analytics (and who isn't?), this matters. A lot.

## Who Actually Needs This?

**You definitely need Termly if:**
- You collect ANY personal information (emails, names, addresses)
- You use cookies or tracking pixels
- You run an eCommerce store
- You have users in Europe or California
- You use third-party services (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)
- You run a mobile app that collects data
- You're a blogger using affiliate links or ads

**You might not need paid Termly if:**
- You have a simple static website with zero data collection
- You're in early development with no users yet
- You have an in-house legal team (lucky you)

## The Bottom Line

Look, privacy compliance isn't going away. If anything, it's getting more complex with every new law that passes.

Termly's pricing is actually pretty fair. At $180/year for Pro+, you're spending less than what one hour with a lawyer would cost you. And unlike that lawyer, Termly updates automatically when laws change.

The free plan is great for getting started. But once you're making real money or handling real customer data, stepping up to Starter or Pro+ just makes sense. Think of it as insurance — boring but necessary.

## How to Get Started

1. 👉 [Head to Termly's website](https://termly.io)
2. Sign up for free (literally just email and name)
3. Answer some questions about your business
4. Generate your policies
5. Add them to your site (copy-paste or embed code)
6. Actually sleep at night knowing you're compliant

If you decide to upgrade, remember:
- Annual billing = 25% off
- Look for promo codes (PRIVACY2026 may still work)
- 30-day money-back guarantee

## Final Thoughts

Privacy compliance is one of those things that's easy to ignore until it's not. By then, you're dealing with complaints, fines, or worse.

Termly won't make compliance fun (let's be honest, nothing will). But it makes it manageable, affordable, and actually doable for normal people without law degrees.

Is it perfect? No. Will it cover every possible edge case? Probably not. But for the vast majority of websites and apps out there, it's more than enough to keep you legal and let you focus on actually building your business.

And at $15 a month for unlimited everything? That's cheaper than most people's coffee habit.

👉 [Try Termly free today](https://termly.io) — no credit card required for the free plan. You can always upgrade later when you're ready to get serious about compliance.
